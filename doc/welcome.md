## What is MDDLib

MDDLib is a library to create and manipulate Multi-valud Decision Diagrams, written in **Java 11**.\
MDDLib is designed to be able to run without a garbage collector. In order to do so, give as JVM option one of the following :  

* `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseEpsilonGC`
* `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseSerialGC`


This library is a work in progress. **As such, we do not guarantee any forward compatibility.**

## Tools

### MDDViewer
This allows you to visualise a .dot file on your browser, without having to install anything. This was made using the [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) library under MIT License.  
MDDLib is able to generate MDDs under .dot format.

## Roadmap

* [x] **\[90%]** Adding support for pure Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs).
  * [x] BDD class and components fully implemented
  * [x] Operations between BDD implemented
  * [ ] Loading / saving in testing phase
* [x] **\[90%]** Adding a proxy MDD type to perform operation without loading the whole MDD.
  * [x] Rewrote the base engine for saving / loading DDs
  * [x] Proxy class and components to implement
  * [x] Operations between DD and proxy to implement
  * [ ] Testing
* [ ] \[0%] Adding support for non-deterministic MDDs.
  * [ ] ND-MDD class and component to implement
  * [ ] Operations between ND-MDD to implement
  * [ ] Operations between ND-MDD and D-MDD to implement
