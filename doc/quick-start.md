# Quick Start

## Installation
Simply pull the code from the public GitHub repository, accessible here : https://github.com/JungVictor/MDDLib/  

?> We plan to provide a .jar file in the future for people who are only interested in using the library as is.


## Organisation

The library is divided into two modules : :card_file_box:core and :open_file_folder:dev.  
The :card_file_box:core module contains all the core code of the library. If you are a simple user, you should probably not write code inside of this module.  

The :open_file_folder:dev module has a dependency to the :card_file_box:core module. It contains all the "WIP" code destined to be later integrated into the :card_file_box:core or the "user code". As such, I recommend you put your own code inside this module.  

?> If you would like to know more about the core code of the library, I recommend you check the "deep-dive" documentation.

## Beginner's Tutorial

In order to better understand the basic usage of the library, a step by step tutorial is available starting from the next page:

If you feel adventurous, go ahead and try the library for yourself. Do not hesitate to read the rest of the documentation / user guide; there are plenty example given to simplify the comprehension of the code.
